              I started my Computer Science journey in 2020, at the time of
              pandemic. I was always curious how can a piece of metal which is
              non-living(our PC’s CPU) can do logic ? <br /><br />
              I started reading about computer’s history back in 2020 and opted
              for Bachelor’s of Computer Applications in 2021. I started with
              some low-level languages like Assembly, C but wasn’t getting any
              working application out of them, then I suddenly stumbled upon
              many amazing animated websites and got into creative web
              development, where I created many Web Applications, Creative
              Websites for brands and also worked on a Web3 Platform with
              React.js. <br /><br />
              I now have 3+ years of experience and I am currently working at
              Pallavi Nopany Design Studio as Lead Developer, where I build
              Client Projects and lead junior developers of other agencies in
              creative development. <br /><br />
              In the meantime I learn and do Low-Level programming and also
              study backend development regularly to become a full-stack
              developer. I am still in the final year of my degree and I am open
              to more exciting opportunities.
